A more efficient FramedContentTBS structure in Messsaging Layer Security
                                 (MLS)
                draft-mahy-mls-new-framed-content-tbs-00

Abstract

   Most MLS signatures are signed over the relatively large GroupContext
   structure.  This document defines a way to safely sign using a pre-
   hashed version of the GroupContext structure for better efficiency.

1.  Introduction

   In MLS [RFC9420] all in-member application, commit, and proposal
   messages (whether sent via a PublicMessage, PrivateMessage or
   SemiPrivateMessage [I-D.mahy-mls-semiprivatemessage]); and all
   external commits contain a signature of the FramedContentTBS
   structure.  This structure contains the full GroupContext of the
   group, which can store a large amount of group state.  (For example,
   in the MIMI protocol [I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol] it contains the
   participant list for the group, which could contain thousands of
   URIs.)

   The GroupContext only changes once per epoch, therefore it is an
   excellent candidate to pre-hash and cache for efficiency reasons.

   This document defines an a replacement for the FramedContentTBS
   structure that uses a pre-hashed GroupContext, and an MLS extension
   for safely negotiating the use of the new struct.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Mechanism

   This document defines the new_framed_content_tbs extension.  When
   present in a LeafNode.capabilities.extensions list, it indicates that
   the client supports this extension.  When present in the
   required_capabilities.extension_types list in GroupContext.extensions
   it indicates that every member of the group MUST use the new
   FramedContentTBS structure.

   The FramedContentTBS structure is replaced with the new structure
   below.  The only change is that the GroupContext is replaced with a
   hash (from the group's current MLS cipher suite) of the GroupContext.

   context_hash = RefHash(GroupContext);

   struct {
       ProtocolVersion version = mls10;
       WireFormat wire_format;
       FramedContent content;
       select (FramedContentTBS.content.sender.sender_type) {
           case member:
           case new_member_commit:
               opaque context_hash<V>;
           case external:
           case new_member_proposal:
               struct{};
       };
   } FramedContentTBS;

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the addition of a new MLS Extension Type value
   under the heading of "Messaging Layer Security".

   RFC EDITOR: Please replace XXXX throughout with the RFC number
   assigned to this document.

   The new_framed_content_tbs MLS Extension Type is used inside LeafNode
   and GroupContext objects.  In a LeafNode it indicates support the the
   extension.  In the required_capabilities of the GroupContext it
   indicates the extension is being used.

   Value: 0x000b (suggested)

   Name: new_framed_content_tbs

   Message(s): GC,LN: This extension may appear in GroupContext and
   LeafNode objects

   Recommended: Y

   Reference: RFC XXXX
